Student Information System

    1. writing some description about the project (at least a paragraph)
    2. the project must contain at least one two-dimensional array
        i) create a array contain the id and marks of students for calculate the average mark
    3. the project must could cope with multiple information
    4. the project must satisfy the properties of object oriented programming
        i) StudentToolImpl(Class) implement SystemTool(Interface) extends StudentInfo(Class)
        ii) SystemMenu(Class) extend SystemInfo(Class)
    5. the project should contain follow functions:
        a) insert data to array
            create method insertData
        b) delete data from array
            create method deleteData
        c) find data from array
            create method findData
        d) modify a data in array
            create method modifyData
        e) display all data in ascending order by sorting
            create method displayData
        f) process data from two-dimensional array to calculate an important output
            create method calculateData
        g) display data for every interaction by user
    6. the project must contain a nice menu
        i)create systemMenu class to design menu
    7. use project management
